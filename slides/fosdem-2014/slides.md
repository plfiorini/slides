title: What is this stuff?

Maui:

- Convenient way to distribute the desktop
- GNU/Linux stack, Qt, Hawaii
- Atomic, safe updates and upgrades (OSTree)
- Download only what's changed, zlib compressed
- Bundles instead of packages
- Focused on Qt and desktop needs

Hawaii:

- Low footprint Wayland and QtQuick based desktop
- Modular, less dependencies
- Adapt to different devices
- Customizable layouts
- Easier styling

title: Updates often gets in your way

This is during yum update: the system is in an inconsistent state

title: Updates

- Step 1: fetch updates and apply them atomically
- Step 2: reboot into the updated system

Advantages:

- **If something fails at step 1 you won't reboot into a broken system**
- Updates are atomic, only one reboot
- No need for rescue partitions or BTRFS snapshots
- Ability to reboot into older version in case of regressions
- Same workflow for **upgrades to the new OS release**

title: mauibuild
subtitle: What it does now

- Base system built from [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/)
- Builds git repositories from core up to Hawaii, plus a few apps
- Can build continuosly
- Outputs different trees: runtime, runtime-debug, devel, devel-debug
- Targets bare metal
- Creates live images

---

title: mauibuild
subtitle: Ideas for the future

- Pick a more complete base system (e.g. Mer, Fedora) and only build Qt and Hawaii
- Focus on continuous integration, smoke tests and QA
- Only target virtualized environments
- No security updates

---

title: Hawaii: philosophy
class: big

- Collaborate with upstream
- Reuse other libraries when possible
- Avoid unnecessary or bloated stuff
- Only support Wayland
- Adapt to diffent form factors
- Modular desktop with components
- Easy and reliable API for styles
