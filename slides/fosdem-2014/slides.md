title: What is this stuff?

Hawaii:

- Low footprint Wayland and QtQuick based desktop
- Less dependencies
- Adapt to different devices
- Customizable layouts, easier styling and theming

Maui:

- Small distro: GNU/Linux stack, Qt, Hawaii
- Convenient way to distribute the desktop
- Atomic and safe updates (OSTree)
- Bundles instead of packages
- Focused on Qt

title: Updates often gets in your way
class: nobackground fill
content_class: flexbox vcenter

This is during yum update: the system is in an inconsistent state

title: mauibuild
subtitle: What it does now

- Written in Python, derived from gnome-ostree
- Base system built from [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/)
- Builds git repositories listed in a JSON manifest
- Can build continuosly
- Outputs different trees: runtime, runtime-debug, devel, devel-debug
- Targets bare metal
- Creates live images

---

title: mauibuild
subtitle: Ideas for the future

- Pick a more complete base system (e.g. Mer, Fedora)
- Build a few things from git sources
- Smoke tests and QA

---

title: Updates

- Step 1: fetch updates and apply them atomically
- Step 2: reboot into the updated system

Advantages:

- **If something fails at step 1 you won't reboot into a broken system**
- Updates are atomic, only one reboot
- No need for rescue partitions or BTRFS snapshots
- Ability to reboot into older version in case of regressions
- Same workflow for **upgrades to the new OS release**

---

title: Hawaii: philosophy
class: big

- Only support Wayland
- Minimalist UI
- Adapt to diffent devices and form factors
- Modular desktop with components
- Easy styling and theming thanks to QML
- Promote third party applications
- Collaborate with upstream when possible
- Reuse other libraries when possible

title: Few dependencies
class: fill
content_class: flexbox vcenter

---

title: KDE Frameworks

- Less dependencies (especially with tier 1 libs)
- Code ready to be used, less duplication
- More people involved, more stable code
- Larger userbase

---

title: Low memory footprint
content_class: flexbox vcenter

**Consumes approximately 60:70 MB**

---

title: Convergence

- Single code base
- Different layout for different devices
- QFileSelector and QQmlAbstractUrlInterceptor
