title: Goals
class: big

Linux distribution:

- Atomic, safe updates and upgrades
- Download only what's changed, zlib compressed
- Bundles instead of packages
- Focused on Qt

Desktop:

- Low footprint Wayland and QtQuick based desktop
- Adapt to different form factors
- Fast boot

title: OSTree: git for operating system binaries

- Manage a set of read-only, versioned and bootable file system trees
- Pick the best out of package-based and images-based deployment
- Drops flexibility of packages to gain image speed and reliability
- Can be served from static HTTP
- Can boot different operating systems and bisect across builds
- Storage and file system independent (works on all file systems, LLVM, ...)
- Can be used to update virtual guests while offline
- Work in progress: yum integration (see [here](http://fedorapeople.org/~walters/fedora-ostree/))

---

title: mauibuild
subtitle: What it does now

- Builds git repositories from core up to Hawaii, plus a few apps
- Can build continuosly
- Base system built from [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/)
- Outputs different variants: runtime, runtime-debug, devel, devel-debug
- Targets bare metal
- Creates live images

---

title: mauibuild
subtitle: Ideas for the future

- Pick a more complete base system (i.e. Fedora minimal) and only build Qt and Hawaii
- Focus on continuous integration, smoke tests and QA
- Only target virtualized environments
- No security updates

title: Atomic upgrades
class: nobackground fill

Updates often break your system: this is during yum update

title: Fedora offline updates

Fedora implemented [offline updates](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/OfflineSystemUpdates) (more [here](http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/SystemUpdates/)):

- Step 1: fetch updates
- Step 2: reboot into a special "update mode"
- Step 3: apply updates **(what happens if this fails?)**
- Step 4: reboot into "regular mode"

Downside:

- Too many reboots
- yum update can still break the system
- Difference between OS and application updates is heuristic
- Delta RPMs are per package not per tree diffs

---

title: Maui atomic updates

- Step 1: fetch updates and apply them atomically
- Step 2: reboot into the updated system

Advantages:

- **If something fails at step 1 you won't reboot into a broken system**
- Updates are atomic, only one reboot
- No need for rescue partitions or BTRFS snapshots
- Ability to reboot into older version in case of regressions
- Same workflow for **upgrades to the new OS release**

---

title: Bundles

- Multiple versions of the same application at the same time
- OS updates decoupled from application updates
- 1:1 relationship between a bundle and an application
- Encourages ABI stability
- Moves the packaging burden to the vendor
